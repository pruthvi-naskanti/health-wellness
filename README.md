## Statement of purpose
WalkTracker is a free to download and use mobile application which provides a health promotional service assisting users to track their health and wellness progress. We plan to develop a software that helps to see better results in weight loss, building muscles, toning up, or controlling medical conditions. Premium plans along with personal coaching with fun health group and wellness challenges, while also being able to share results.

## Objective
Having a fit and healthy body is everyone's dream, but it has somehow not been everyone's cup of tea. Between 2017 and 2018, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey observes 1 out of every 4 children are suffering from Obesity, also obesity is linked to more than 60 chronic diseases and there is epidemic of obesity around the world.

In the U.S, childhood obesity alone is estimated to cost $14 billion annually in direct health expenses. Unhealthy lifestyle and eating habits has direct impact on physical health causing damage to metabolism, which has impact on mental well-being too. Most part of the problem comes from a lack of awareness of what people are eating and how much energy they burn every day.

WalkTracker is a digital technology to help people eat better, get fitter and lose weight. The primary solution is delivered via a smartphone app (iOS, Android) with a team of qualified diet/ fitness expert’s available in-app. It also allows optional integration with various tracking wearables. The funds would be used in developing AI and ML interface, so that it can service more users with fitness suggestions, healthy alternative food and task recommendations.

Our app will help users to track their health and wellness progress using step count. Also, will be providing points based on the steps count. The rewarded points can be used to buy products like Our University T-Shirts,Caps.

## Benefits
1. The app helps users to track their steps, food intake and other health measurements which helps to track their health.
2. Users who gained points which can be used to buy products in our App market.
3. The user statistical data can be used to predict users health prior to attack.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
![ERD](https://github.com/RaviTeja444/health-wellness/blob/master/GDP1_ERD.png?raw=true)

## Entities Description

The following ER Diagram has various tables. Coming to the User table initially user want to login to the Walk tracker he/she needs create an account in the Walk Tracker. For this, User has to fill out various details in the Walk Tracker App.

In the Daily Level table the step count is automatically updated in the APP while user moving.

Next, User_Role column in USER table indicates whether a user is admin or not. An admin role user in the USER table can create different Groups and each group has different group members. Admin can invite various members into the Group so Group member has option to accept or else reject the invitation.All these members are stored in GROUP_MEMBER Table.

Admin can create a CHALLENGE. The  Challenge_Name table have  different challenges, In that user can store challenge created date and lastly Date_LEFT_ACCESSED.Each Challenge is associated with a Target which is stored in TARGET table. The Target Table is going to stores target description and Target_numerical _Goal. Every Challenge has a Target based on the Challenge_Id.

Finally the User Points is calculated based on step count stored in DAILYLEVEL table. USER_POINTS will have userid and userpoints information.



## Business Rules for the ER Diagram:

A certain HEALTH WELLNEESS is interested in storing information about 
USER,DAILYLEVEL,USER_POINTS,CHALLENGE_NAME,GROUP_MEMBER,GROUP AND TARGET.

For each USER,The HEALTH WELLNESS would like to store a Unique UserId, EMAIL,USER_NAME,USER_ROLE,PASSWORD,DATE CREATED,DATE_LAST_ACCESSED,HEIGHT,WEIGHT,IS DIABETES,AGE,GENDER.

For each GROUP,The Health wellness would like to store a Group unique Id,name,Creator and Date_Created,Date_Last_EDited.

FOR each Group_Member, The Health wellness  would like to store a unique GROUP_MEMBER_ID, DATE_INVITED,DATE_ACCEPTED_INVITE,DATE_REJECTED_INVITE,DATE_LEFT_GROUP.

FOR each DAILYLEVEL, The HEALTH WELLNES would like to store a unique DAILYLEVEL_ID  UserId,step count, Hydration_level,Sleep_hours,Fruits_consumed,Calories_consumed,OTHERS,Date_of_measurement

FOR each USER_POINTS, The HEALTH WELLNESS would like to store a unique USER_POINTS_ID,USER POINTS.

FOR each TARGET, The Health wellness would like to store a unique TARGET_ID,TARGET_NAME,TARGET_DESCRIPTION AND TARGET_NUMERICAL_GOAL.

FOR each CHALLENGE_NAME, The HEALTH WELLNESS would like to store a unique CHALLENGE_ID CHALLENGE_NAME,designer,date_created,date_last_accessed.
