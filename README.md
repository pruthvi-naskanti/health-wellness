In the U.S, childhood obesity alone is estimated to cost $14 billion annually in direct health expenses. Unhealthy lifestyle and eating habits has direct impact on physical health causing damage to metabolism, which has impact on mental well-being too. Most part of the problem comes from a lack of awareness of what people are eating and how much energy they burn every day.
